# Locomotive-Drywall Seed
[Drywall](http://jedireza.github.io/drywall/) repackaged into a [Locomotive](http://locomotivejs.org/) app.

An attempt to merge the MVC app architecture and superior routing capabilities of [Locomotive](http://locomotivejs.org/) with the awesome, ready-to-use landing pages and user management of [Drywall](http://jedireza.github.io/drywall/).

**This is very much a work in progress at the moment.**

The end product ought to let you check out this code (already structured as per `lcm create`) and start coding directly as with any Locomotive app, except that you have all the nifty drywall pages ready and working out of the box!

Further documentation soon to come.
