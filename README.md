# Locomotive-Drywall Seed
[Drywall](http://jedireza.github.io/drywall/) repackaged into a [Locomotive](http://locomotivejs.org/) app.

An attempt to merge the MVC architecture and advanced routing of [Locomotive](http://locomotivejs.org/) with the ready-to-use UI and user management of [Drywall](http://jedireza.github.io/drywall/).

**This is very much a work in progress at the moment.**

When it is ready, you should be able to clone this repo (already structured as per `lcm create`) and start coding directly as with any Locomotive app, except that you will start with drywall functionality available out of the box!

Further documentation coming soon.
